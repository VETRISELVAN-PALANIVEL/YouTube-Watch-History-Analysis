# YouTube Watch History Analysis

This project analyzes my personal YouTube watch history to uncover viewing patterns and content preferences. Using Python, it extracts time-based insights to reveal peak viewing hours, frequent days, and top video titles. Pandas is used for data cleaning, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizations, providing clear insights into my YouTube viewing habits.
